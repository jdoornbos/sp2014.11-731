another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
attended , among others , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republican in the senate and a prominent opponent of health - care law .
nothing new : two judges attend events society 's federalists have already been for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , things which are now viewed in the court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to critics who say that they very readily mixed case with the court фигурирующими in matters of groups like society federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is against the judge elena kagan ethical question arises , rather than scalia and thomas .
her criticism , demanded that kagan has abandoned its hearings on this case , because she was too involved in the protection of the law then , to be impartial now .

mexican president 's sister , obviously , lost the election in michoacan
president felipe calderon 's sister , it seems , not made their bid for the governor 's seat michoacan during the fierce state elections , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and particularly alarming , not only for michoacan , but yesterday and for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon радиоинтервью in the next day , sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades , is not yet lost the presidency in 2000 .

ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .

раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia could be up to some extent is protected , but she may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

he said that the vulnerable emerging markets need to make " contingency plans " , to protect themselves from the downturn and the most significant оттоков capital from their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release of the pentagon from reductions , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops with shell , but without the putter .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been undergoing tests , and only some of the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or to change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

replacing analog signals on the digital - one of the most important changes that the world in recent years .

olga sanchez кордеро draft statement prepared by the minister , offered to declare the decree unconstitutional , because the regulation of the radio and television programs - right , enshrined in law for the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of principles hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve .
on this argument and the senate , and spent two constitutional debate , chamber of deputies to refute the decree and to support the complaints , sanchez кордеро minister suspended the application of the decree and all actions , the him regarding the transition to digital broadcasting .

monti 's chances of success were largely based on the support of party the ldp prime minister silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign saturday due to the crisis .
support for the ldp , the biggest party in italy , has a meaning , because until now , many of its members opposed the government majority , which consists of monti 's technocrats , which forms .
monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for reform , which is likely to continue to be unpopular austerity reforms .
an italian association of foreign banks increased the pressure , warning that failure to monti could become a scourge .
after a short respite at the end of last week , when it became clear , that berlusconi would resign , the value of debt in italy reached critical levels against the backdrop of uncertainty now in whether a new prime minister , will be successful .

so , or if someone wants to put the gates on the field .
competition , and their organizational side , and their impact on the city , barcelona are the topic for discussion all architects .

for рольдана , after reaching the shoreline is becoming " necessary " to discuss " the front side of the mountain " , when a proposal ильдефона серды with green apples , the mountain , was not done .
модоло as рольдан and байона with experience in the city building , called the proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some of the dangers " .
first fear is a proper restriction boundaries , where you can build .
" we need to think about new urban planning , because current instruments [ with regard to the general of the capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which asks the name of this part , complex , as in the rules of the contest lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . "
on the other hand , a project for some gate may overlap on the program , and identifying with the project architect for a neighboring gate .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , has developed a polymer - modified bitumen , to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable exposed to the environment and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specialist in the field of chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well .
at асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam .
as well as a member of the national transportation system , researchers explained that load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be connected to transport load and it is necessary to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .
what lacked candidate from the valle , in order to become a new miss colombia ?
at this time мелина ramirez serna was supposed to be contented with what was on the podium winners with a silver crown and ribbon , proclaiming her new princess colombia .

between the magazine , a journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone major surgery .
her body has never been her advantage , and here she was punished for it .
so it or not , the fact that we have today мелины begins year rule , not as queen , but as the princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia directly on one of the international competition , the organizers of the national contest .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
here is why germany remains alone in her decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is only a few of those who strongly continues their projects .
although germany 's model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .

both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it 's without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , on average , 150 000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as the need and хаотическом alright .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness , and from lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but gradually loses its sovereignty , and the entire europe along with her each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to represent her without a stronger economic integration , political and democratic , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
